# Paper Cut - Ludumdare 32 Jam Project

This game was made with a 3 1/2  person crew in 16 hours during Ludum Dare 32. The goal for the group was to make a small and manageable game given the reduced time frame and relative inexperience with a game jam the crew had. What came out of this effort was a kitty lunching romp of an asteroid clone. Have fun and don’t for get to follow us on twitter for more crazy adventures.

I want to thank our family and friends for their support and patience during our time away from them, You guys rock.
